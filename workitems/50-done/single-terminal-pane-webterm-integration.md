# Integrate single terminal pane via rcarmo/webterm

## Summary

Design and implement a single terminal pane in the web UI, based on `rcarmo/webterm`, to allow command-line access from inside the workspace experience.

The terminal renders as a **docked sub-panel** below the tabbed editor area
(horizontal split with draggable splitter), not as a tab. It persists across
tab switches — mounted once, toggled visible/hidden. This mirrors VS Code's
integrated terminal layout.

This work is gated on the pane extension system which defines the `placement: "dock"` contract.

## Blockers

- `workitems/50-done/extension-system-refactor-for-editor-and-terminal.md` (pane contract with dock placement — now shipped)
- `workitems/50-done/tabbed-editor-interface-design-and-discussion.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- Validate feasibility and integration approach for `rcarmo/webterm`:
  - embedding model (iframe/component/direct integration)
  - lifecycle (start/stop/reconnect)
  - session ownership (per user/session/chat)
- Define security model:
  - auth/CSRF/session checks in web channel
  - command execution boundaries and workspace path constraints
  - rate limits and abuse controls
- Define UX behavior for docked terminal sub-panel:
  - horizontal split below tabbed editor area with draggable splitter
  - toggle open/close via keyboard shortcut (`` Ctrl+` ``) and UI button
  - persistent across tab switches (not re-created on tab change)
  - splitter height saved to localStorage
  - terminal-only mode when no file tabs are open
  - responsive behavior on tablet/mobile
- Implement MVP behind feature flag/config toggle.
- Add tests and operational notes.

## Implementation Paths

### Path A — Embedded webterm component in dock pane (recommended)
1. Run webterm backend as managed service/process.
2. Implement `TerminalPaneExtension` with `placement: "dock"`.
3. Add authenticated session bootstrap endpoint.
4. Wire toggle/focus behavior into dock area state.
5. Add reconnect and terminal-reset actions.

Pros: practical, low integration overhead.
Cons: requires careful auth/session wiring.

### Path B — iframe isolation model
1. Host webterm at isolated route/subdomain.
2. Embed via iframe and bridge focus/resize via postMessage.
3. Keep strict CSP and origin checks between host app and terminal frame.

Pros: strong isolation.
Cons: more UX friction and embedding complexity.

### Path C — Native terminal protocol integration
1. Integrate PTY/session handling directly in piclaw backend.
2. Use terminal frontend component without external webterm service boundary.

Pros: deep control and unified architecture.
Cons: larger implementation burden and security surface.

## Recommended Path

Adopt **Path A** for MVP after tabbed layout decisions land; reserve **Path B** if stronger isolation is required.

## Updates

### 2026-03-16
- Closed as functionally superseded.
- A terminal pane, backend PTY/session service, WebSocket transport, ghostty-web frontend integration, and docked terminal UX have now shipped in core.
- The remaining distinct concerns are narrower follow-ups such as endpoint/security hardening and windowing/pop-out behaviour, which are already tracked elsewhere.
- The original `rcarmo/webterm` framing is no longer the active implementation path.

### 2026-03-14
- Re-inspected `rcarmo/webterm` as the backend/session reference model while vendoring terminal frontend assets.
- Current useful takeaway: `webterm` still represents the right shape for the server side of this feature — authenticated HTTP/WebSocket bootstrap around a PTY/session service.
- In parallel, the frontend side now has a vendored `ghostty-web` fork available locally (`rcarmo/ghostty-web` pinned by commit) and the terminal dock pane can bootstrap that frontend in a local/no-backend mode.
- That means this ticket no longer needs to answer "which browser terminal frontend?" before it starts; the remaining blocked work is the secure session/PTY bridge and endpoint model.

### 2026-03-12
- Board quality review: added explicit test plan and DoD checklist.
- Quality: ★★★★☆ 8/10 (problem: 2, scope: 2, test: 1, deps: 2, risk: 1)
- Gap: blocked on pane/tab contract work and still needs the final security/session model choice.

### 2026-03-11
- Updated to reflect docked sub-panel model (horizontal split below editor tabs, not a tab itself).
- Added explicit blocker on extension-system-refactor (pane contract with `placement: "dock"`).
- Updated acceptance criteria with dock-specific UX requirements.

### 2026-03-11
- Added implementation-path analysis and MVP recommendation.
- Created as a follow-on to the tabbed editor design ticket.
- Marked blocked until tabbed editor design/discussion is settled.

## Test Plan

- **Architecture:** validate the chosen embedding/session model against the final pane contract.
- **Security:** test auth/origin/session boundaries for terminal bootstrap and reconnect flows.
- **UX:** manual validation of dock visibility, splitter persistence, keyboard shortcut, and tab-switch persistence.
- **Responsive:** verify desktop + tablet/mobile behavior before promoting out of blocked.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria satisfied and verified
- [ ] Security model documented with explicit trust/session boundaries
- [ ] MVP implemented behind feature flag/config toggle
- [ ] Dock UX validated manually on desktop and touch device(s)
- [ ] Operational notes documented
- [ ] Quality score ≥ 9 recorded in final update
- [ ] Ticket front matter updated (`status`, `updated`, `completed`)
- [ ] Ticket moved to `50-done/`

## Notes

Key design question: should terminal state be ephemeral per browser session or restorable across reconnects?
