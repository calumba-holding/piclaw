# Vendor and embed draw.io editor as an extension-pane with SVG/PNG export

## Summary

Add a first-class **diagram editor pane** in the web UI using the existing `WebPaneExtension` mechanism. The pane should embed a draw.io (diagrams.net) editor, support opening `.drawio`/`.dio`/`*.xml` diagram files from the workspace, and export both **SVG** and **PNG** outputs.

This ticket includes both:

1. **Vendoring/build pipeline** for the chosen draw.io web runtime.
2. **Editor pane extension** that hooks into `panes`/`tab` lifecycle.
3. **Export flow** from the pane to workspace or attachment context.
4. **Candidate sweep** with at least one VS Code extension inspiration path.

## Why

The current workspace editor is text-first. A true diagram editor improves architecture/design workflows, status reporting visuals, and planning diagrams directly in the same workspace flow.

## Current candidate options (known) to research/verify

Based on ecosystem familiarity and prior art:

- `hediet.vscode-drawio` (VS Code extension, strong feature parity for draw.io editing)
- diagrams.net / draw.io `embed` integration path (`embed.diagrams.net`)
- `jgraph/drawio` (upstream diagrams.net editor/runtime source)
- `mxgraph` / `@maxgraph/core`-style drawing runtime lineage for possible local embedding
- Self-hosted/editor-hosted integration patterns used by existing VS Code drawio extensions

> Action required: verify exact packaging + licensing + offline/local-hosting suitability for each option before implementation.

## Upstream references to track

### UX / integration reference
- `hediet/vscode-drawio`
  - GitHub: `https://github.com/hediet/vscode-drawio`
  - Why it matters:
    - proven desktop/editor embedding model for draw.io files
    - useful reference for save/export behavior, editor lifecycle, and file association expectations
    - likely reference point for how users expect `.drawio` editing to behave inside a tabbed editor environment

### Runtime / asset source of truth
- `jgraph/drawio`
  - GitHub: `https://github.com/jgraph/drawio`
  - Why it matters:
    - authoritative upstream source for the diagrams.net runtime/assets
    - likely source of the embeddable editor build or static assets we would vendor
    - should drive provenance, version tracking, and offline-hosting assumptions

## Embedding and vendoring plan (initial)

### Preferred architecture
Use a **local vendored diagrams.net embed runtime** hosted from PiClaw static assets, wrapped by a **pane extension** that opens in the tabbed editor area.

### Proposed shape
1. **Vendor a local draw.io runtime**
   - Add a dedicated vendor script or manifest-driven workflow to pull a reproducible upstream build from `jgraph/drawio`.
   - Store vendored assets under a stable static path, likely alongside other large browser-side vendor artifacts.
   - Keep the runtime lazy-loaded rather than merged into `app.bundle.js`.

2. **Add a host page / bridge**
   - Serve a local host page for the draw.io iframe/embed runtime.
   - Use a strict `postMessage` bridge for:
     - load/open diagram XML
     - save back to PiClaw
     - export SVG
     - export PNG
     - dirty-state / ready-state notifications

3. **Add a pane extension**
   - Register a new `WebPaneExtension` with high priority for:
     - `.drawio`
     - `.dio`
     - selected `.xml` cases where the file is draw.io-shaped
   - Open the editor in the existing tabbed pane area rather than as a separate app surface.

4. **Integrate workspace persistence**
   - Load content via existing workspace file APIs.
   - Save edited XML via `updateWorkspaceFile`.
   - Keep file ownership and path semantics identical to other editor tabs.

5. **Add explicit export actions**
   - `Export SVG`
   - `Export PNG`
   - Prefer deterministic save-to-workspace first, with attachment/timeline flow as an optional second step.

### Why this plan
- aligns with PiClaw’s existing pane-extension model in `docs/web-pane-extensions.md`
- keeps draw.io isolated as a heavyweight lazy-loaded editor surface
- avoids remote runtime dependencies at use time
- preserves an offline/self-hosted story
- keeps vendoring/provenance compatible with the repo’s newer vendor workflow direction

### Planning constraints
- Do **not** load remote `embed.diagrams.net` at runtime in production use.
- Treat `hediet/vscode-drawio` as an integration/UX reference, not as the vendored runtime.
- Treat `jgraph/drawio` as the authoritative provenance source unless research proves a cleaner officially-supported embeddable package path.
- Prefer extension-local editor code plus vendored static assets over hard-coding logic into the main app bundle.

## Scope

### In scope
- Implement one pane that can:
  - load `.drawio`, `.dio`, and `.xml` diagram files into an editor
  - save updates back to workspace file
  - export current diagram as SVG and PNG
- Vendored editor assets in-repo for reproducible builds.
- Register the pane via the extension mechanism (`WebPaneExtension`).
- Add command/UI affordance for export (`Export SVG`, `Export PNG`).
- Keep non-functional styling consistent with existing clean functional visual direction.

### Out of scope
- Full cloud diagram sharing / multi-document sync
- Generalized visual editor plugin marketplace
- Full webterm/AI-assisted diagram generation (future follow-up)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Draw.io/diagrams.net editor runtime is embedded as an **editor pane extension** (tabs placement).
- [ ] `.drawio` files can be opened in the pane by default (with clear overrides if extension/mode not detected).
- [ ] Pane persists changes to workspace via existing file APIs.
- [ ] Export action supports:
  - `SVG` download
  - `PNG` download
  - both saved into workspace or surfaced for attach in timeline workflow.
- [ ] Export format selection is explicit and deterministic.
- [ ] Draw.io runtime is vendored/reproducible (no ad-hoc remote dependency at runtime).
- [ ] Manual test exists for open/edit/export cycle.
- [ ] Ticket updates include which candidate path was selected and why.

## Implementation paths

### Path A — `embed.diagrams.net` in iframe + postMessage bridge (recommended first)
1. Add a vendored local/static loader strategy around draw.io web embed.
2. Implement draw.io pane as a thin wrapper around an iframe / host bridge.
3. Implement open/save + export via `postMessage` contract.
4. On save, persist XML/string content through `updateWorkspaceFile`.
5. Add explicit `Export SVG` and `Export PNG` menu actions.

**Pros:** fast to ship, avoids building complex editor internals; preserves diagrams semantics from source.  
**Cons:** cross-window messaging contract complexity; must harden security/sizing.

### Path B — direct canvas integration via local drawio/mxgraph bundle
1. Vendor the needed JS libraries directly.
2. Build a custom pane that boots the editor runtime in-container.
3. Expose export APIs directly for SVG/PNG.

**Pros:** more control, fewer embedding assumptions.
**Cons:** significantly more work; dependency complexity and versioning risk.

### Path C — leverage an existing open editor SDK from VS Code extension source
1. Read one or more VS Code draw.io extensions for architecture and save/export behavior.
2. Re-implement only the compatible subset required for pane mode.

**Pros:** established UX behavior for users with VS Code familiarity.
**Cons:** extension code not designed for browser pane context; adaptation effort high.

## Recommended path

Start with **Path A** for first integration proof, then evaluate Path B only if messaging/security constraints are blocking.

## Candidate investigation tasks (required before implement)

- [ ] Confirm one primary draw.io candidate runtime and verify export API:
  - compare `hediet/vscode-drawio` integration strategy with `jgraph/drawio` upstream runtime shape
  - if iframe-based: confirm command bridge contract for `export` and `load`
  - if bundle-based: verify module entrypoint + runtime CSS/assets + export hooks
- [ ] Validate licensing/commercial terms and whether local/offline hosting is permitted in this repo context.
- [ ] Benchmark bundle size budget vs current `app.bundle.js` and extension lazy-load expectations.
- [ ] Confirm extension path for `.drawio` vs `.xml` vs `.dio`:
  - preview/edit behavior
  - content-type classification
  - file-size caps for this mode
- [ ] Decide vendoring path:
  - manifest-driven vendor workflow vs dedicated draw.io asset script
  - static asset layout under `web/static/...`
  - version/provenance metadata file format
- [ ] Map pane-extension implementation files before coding:
  - pane registration
  - iframe host page / bridge
  - export command UI placement
  - workspace save integration

## Test Plan

### Unit / integration tests

- Add a pane-level test stub for registration and route handling:
  - `.drawio` context selects new pane extension above fallback editor.
  - Unsupported paths fall back to editor.
- Add a service-level test for workspace MIME/text handling if `.drawio`/`.xml` detection is changed.
- Add export flow tests for generated artifacts (mocked SVG/PNG payloads).

### Manual validation

1. Open an existing `.drawio` file from workspace explorer.
2. Edit diagram and save.
3. Verify diff/updated file appears in workspace tree + preview flow.
4. Export SVG; verify file contents openable and readable inline.
5. Export PNG; verify image renders and can be attached/presented.
6. Smoke restart and load from cold cache.

### Automated verification

- `cd /workspace/piclaw && bun run test`
- `cd /workspace/piclaw && make build-piclaw`
- `cd /workspace/piclaw/piclaw && bun run build:web`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Candidate runtime decision documented in ticket updates
- [ ] Draw.io pane is registered and usable as a tabbed extension
- [ ] `.drawio` open/edit/save cycle works end-to-end
- [ ] SVG and PNG exports both functional
- [ ] Vendored build path is deterministic and documented
- [ ] All acceptance criteria verified and checklist checked
- [ ] Front matter updated to `status: done` + `completed`
- [ ] Ticket moved to `50-done/` when shipped

## Updates

### 2026-03-16
- Marked functionally superseded by the shipped draw.io work tracked under the newer draw.io extension tickets.
- Vendoring, route-based serving, pane integration, and workspace export/save flows have now landed in practice.
- Any remaining narrower gaps should be tracked as focused follow-up tickets rather than keeping this original broad pane ticket active.

### 2026-03-14
- Annotated the ticket with explicit upstream references:
  - `https://github.com/hediet/vscode-drawio`
  - `https://github.com/jgraph/drawio`
- Clarified planning direction:
  - treat `hediet/vscode-drawio` as UX/integration reference
  - treat `jgraph/drawio` as runtime/provenance source of truth
  - prefer a locally vendored embed runtime wrapped by a pane extension and postMessage bridge
- Added a first-pass vendoring/embedding plan aligned with `piclaw/piclaw/docs/web-pane-extensions.md`.
- Expanded investigation tasks to cover vendoring shape, host-page bridge, extension registration, and export UI placement.
- Quality: ★★★★☆ 8/10 (problem: 2, scope: 2, test: 2, deps: 1, risk: 1)
- Next action: inspect the two upstream repos directly and choose the exact vendoring path (manifest-driven vs dedicated asset workflow).

### 2026-03-12
- User requested ticket to add vendored draw.io editor as an extension pane with SVG/PNG export.
- Added candidate sweep list and phased implementation paths (embed-first, local-bundle alternative, VS Code-inspired adaptation).
