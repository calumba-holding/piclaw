# Design a visible workspace explorer scale control

## Summary

Follow up on the workspace explorer scaling work with a low-priority ticket to
figure out the eventual user-facing control for choosing `compact`, `default`,
and `comfortable` scale presets.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Decide where the control should live (workspace header, settings, context menu, or elsewhere).
- [ ] Define how the control interacts with responsive defaults.
- [ ] Define persistence semantics for explicit user overrides.
- [ ] Ensure the control is understandable on desktop and touch devices.
- [ ] Keep the initial v1 scaling implementation usable even before this UI ships.

## Notes

- Current scaling work intentionally ships without a visible control.
- Existing implementation uses responsive defaults and a stored/internal override path first.
- This ticket is low priority and should not block the current workspace scaling behavior.
