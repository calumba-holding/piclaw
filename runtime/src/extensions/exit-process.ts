/**
 * exit-process – agent-callable tool that gracefully terminates the piclaw process.
 *
 * When the agent needs to restart (e.g. after deploying a new build), it calls
 * this tool as the **last tool call in its turn**. The tool invokes the same
 * graceful shutdown path used by SIGINT/SIGTERM: drain the task queue, dispose
 * all agent sessions (persisting session files), stop the web server and
 * terminal/VNC bridges, then process.exit(0). Supervisor then restarts piclaw
 * with the new code.
 *
 * This replaces the old pattern of scheduling an external `supervisorctl
 * restart` from the deploy script, which could kill the process mid-turn and
 * lose the agent's response.
