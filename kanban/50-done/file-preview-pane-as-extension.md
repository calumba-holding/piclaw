# Convert workspace file preview pane into an extension via the pane extension framework

## Summary

Refactor the workspace explorer file-preview panel to use our existing `WebPaneExtension` mechanism so specific file types can opt into custom preview behavior.

Today the preview rendering logic is hard-coded in `workspace-explorer.ts` (images/text/binary markdown handling inline). We need that flow to become extension-driven, with a default fallback extension and override support for specialized types.

The goal is to support:
- pluggable preview renderers per file type,
- clean extension-based overrides,
- and a stable migration path for richer preview tooling (e.g., PDFs, audio, video, drawio, custom editor-driven previews).

## Why

This unlocks file-type-specific UX without branching the workspace explorer logic. Specific previews (e.g., drawio, structured config, archives, notebooks, images) can be added independently as extensions.

## Current behavior (targeted)

`WorkspaceExplorer` currently renders preview content directly from `preview.kind`:
- images via `<img>`
- markdown via `renderMarkdown`
- text via `<pre><code>`
- binaries as a generic download message

This logic lives in a single component and is not extensible.

## Target design

### 1) Introduce a preview-extension contract using existing framework

Use the current `WebPaneExtension` ecosystem (or a narrow sibling interface) with preview-specific dispatch:
- use pane capabilities (`preview` / `readonly`) for preview providers,
- call `canHandle(context)` with file path and preview payload,
- prioritize explicit extension handlers.

### 2) Register a built-in fallback preview extension

Create a default preview extension that preserves current behavior for:
- image files
- markdown
- short text previews
- binary/unrecognized files (download prompt)

### 3) Hook explorer to extension registry

Resolve and mount preview provider from selected file context in the preview panel:
- try registry handlers first,
- fallback to default extension,
- provide path/mimetype/size/mtime/content/error context.

### 4) Make overrides practical

- new/third-party file extensions can be added in dedicated extension modules,
- higher priority renderers override defaults (e.g., `.drawio`, `.json`, `.csv`, `.ipynb`, binary formats).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] File preview rendering in `WorkspaceExplorer` is dispatched through the extension mechanism.
- [x] A default fallback preview extension is provided and matches current functional behavior.
- [x] At least one non-default override pattern is supported (or one example extension added).
- [x] Existing actions in preview header (download/open-in-editor/delete/new file) continue to work.
- [x] Unsupported/unknown file types still have a safe fallback UI.
- [x] Workspace explorer preview tests are updated to cover extension resolution and fallback behavior.
- [x] Manual behavior of text/image/markdown previews remains functionally unchanged for existing file types.

## In scope
- `piclaw/piclaw/web/src/components/workspace-explorer.ts`
- New/updated preview extension registration in:
  - `piclaw/piclaw/web/src/panes` (or a small `workspace-preview/` sibling)
  - `piclaw/piclaw/web/src/app.ts` when registering preview extensions.
- `piclaw/piclaw/web/src/pane-types.ts` if contract/type additions are needed.
- `piclaw/piclaw/docs/web-pane-extensions.md` for doc update.

## Out of scope
- Reworking the editor pane system itself.
- Replacing file API shapes in `src/channels/web/workspace`.
- Introducing full backend rendering pipelines in this ticket.

## Implementation paths

### Path A — Extend `WebPaneExtension` for preview capability (recommended)
1. Define/standardize a preview context object for selected files.
2. Use existing `paneRegistry` resolution with `PaneCapability`/`canHandle`.
3. Implement built-in fallback preview extension in `web` sources.
4. Add a light `preview` renderer host component inside workspace explorer that mounts/unmounts preview pane instances.

**Pros:** uses the same extension framework and keeps discovery model familiar.

### Path B — New `previewRegistry` (parallel to pane registry)
1. Introduce a separate registry dedicated to workspace previews.
2. Migrate preview rendering only, leaving pane system untouched.

**Pros:** minimal blast radius if extension interface cannot cover both tab and side-pane constraints.

**Cons:** adds another framework instead of leveraging the existing one.

### Path C — API plugin contracts first
1. Add file-preview metadata in workspace API to include renderer hints.
2. Drive extension selection from metadata.

**Pros:** backend-driven, explicit file typing.

**Cons:** couples UI to backend decisions and adds additional scope.

## Recommended path

Start with **Path A** and, if side-pane hosting creates friction, add a thin adapter within `workspace-explorer.ts` rather than creating a parallel registry.

## Test plan

### Automated
- Unit tests for preview resolution and fallback ordering.
- Regression tests for markdown/text/image rendering parity with existing behavior.
- Coverage for extension registration/unregistration lifecycle if implemented via app-level registry.

### Manual
- Open a text file, image, and markdown file in explorer and compare preview output.
- Add a temporary custom override extension for one extension type and verify override wins.
- Confirm download action still appears for binary files.
- Verify selected path changes update preview pane consistently while editing/sse events are in flight.

## Definition of Done

- [x] Extension-based preview dispatch implemented and default fallback preserved.
- [x] One custom override renderer validated.
- [x] Test coverage updated with at least one fallback and one override test.
- [x] No UI regression in explorer preview actions.
- [x] Docs updated for extension authors (preview extension example/registration).
- [x] Ticket front matter updated on completion (`status`, `completed`).

## Updates

### 2026-03-13
- Moved from doing to done after landing the extension-based preview refactor.
- Added `piclaw/web/src/panes/workspace-preview-pane.ts` with a default preview extension plus a higher-priority markdown preview override.
- Updated `workspace-explorer.ts`, pane registration, pane types, and editor routing so view-mode previews resolve through the pane registry instead of inline branches.
- Added `test/web/workspace-preview-pane.test.ts` and a lightweight `piclaw/docs/web-pane-extensions.md` note covering preview extension behavior.
- Validation recorded in implementation work: `bun test test/web/workspace-preview-pane.test.ts`, `bun run build:web`, and `make build-web` passed.

### 2026-03-12
- Added to track converting the workspace explorer preview pane to an extension-driven renderer using the existing extension system so overrides by file type become supported and maintainable.
- Quality (draft): ★★★☆☆ 6/10 (problem: 2, scope: 2, test: 1, deps: 1, risk: 2)
- Next action: decide extension interface shape (pure reuse of `WebPaneExtension` with preview context vs a preview-only adapter) and create first built-in preview extension refactor.
