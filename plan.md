# piclaw code quality improvement plan

Date: 2026-03-09
Scope reviewed: `piclaw/piclaw/src`, `piclaw/piclaw/extensions`, `piclaw/piclaw/web/src`, packaging/build config.

## Review snapshot (updated)

- Backend size: **169 TS files / 22,946 LOC** (`src/`)
- Frontend size: **7,095 LOC** (`web/src/`)
- Tests: **605 passing, 0 failing**
- Lint: passing (for current backend tranche)
- Coverage (line): **57.97%** (`coverage/lcov.info`)
- Review comment coverage: Added focused regression/unit tests for each recent extraction seam (`web/recovery.ts`, `web/agent-buffers.ts`, `web/auth-runtime.ts`, `web/auth-gateway.ts`, `web/endpoint-contexts.ts`, `web/agent-status-store.ts`, `web/pending-steering.ts`, `web/interaction-broadcaster.ts`, `web/followup-placeholders.ts`, `web/chat-run-control.ts`, `runtime/composition.ts`, `runtime/bootstrap.ts`, runtime wiring/provider bootstrap) so refactors remain behavior-preserving.
- Commenting standards coverage: New extraction seams include module headers plus exported type/function JSDoc, and this remains an explicit tracked goal (see checklist + quality bars below).

## 1) Overview table (maintainability, reusability, security, architecture, dead code)

| Area | Current state | Risk | Priority | Main improvements |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| Architecture boundaries | Web router is now modularized under `src/channels/web/http/*`; `runtime.ts` and `web.ts` still large | Medium | P1 | Continue decomposition of runtime/bootstrap and `web.ts` orchestration services |
| Maintainability | Significant improvement in web routing/service extraction; large core files remain | Medium | P1 | Continue focused decomposition + reduce module LOC concentration |
| Reusability | Web helpers now centralized; extension API boundaries still mixed (`src/*` and deep imports in some areas) | Medium | P1 | Stabilize extension-facing internal API and remove brittle deep import paths |
| Type safety / best practices | `any` usage still elevated in selected core modules | Medium | P1 | Add typed DTO/schemas for IPC/runtime/events and reduce high-density `any` hotspots |
| Security (local/web/remote) | P0 hardening implemented and covered by tests | Low | P0 (done) | Maintain + regressions + audit for new surfaces |
| Dead code / stale artifacts | Stale-dist detection in place (allowlist-based); destructive cleanup deferred due in-progress feature constraint | Medium | P1 | Non-destructive inventory -> confirm ownership -> gradual allowlist burn-down |
| Quality gates | Lint/tests/package guard checks in use; coverage bar still below target and redundancy analysis not yet formalized | Medium | P1 | Add CI coverage floor + architecture/static analysis guardrails + test redundancy audit |
| Documentation/commenting standards | Partial consistency; recently extracted seams are documented but standards were not explicit in plan goals | Medium | P1 | Track and enforce module headers + exported API JSDoc for new/refactored seams |

## 2) Detailed checklist of fixes

## P0 (security/release safety)

- [x] **Fix path traversal boundary check for scheduled shell cwd**
  - `src/utils/task-validation.ts` now uses robust containment validation.
  - Regression tests added.

- [x] **Harden client identity for rate limiting/auth logs**
  - Trusted proxy mode added.
  - Centralized request client/origin extraction.

- [x] **Strengthen CSRF origin validation**
  - Full origin tuple validation (scheme+host+port).
  - Security tests updated.

- [x] **Harden remote callback SSRF defenses**
  - DNS resolve + private/loopback/link-local IP blocking (IPv4/IPv6).
  - Remote SSRF tests added.

- [x] **Packaging cleanup / release safety**
  - Runtime packaging guardrails and tarball hygiene checks added.
  - `files` allowlist + stale-dist checks integrated.

- [ ] **Dead/stale artifact cleanup (final destructive pass)**
  - Partial: stale-dist quality gate active with explicit allowlist.
  - Pending: safely retire allowlisted legacy artifacts once in-progress work stabilizes.

## P1 (active wave)

- [x] **Refactor web router into middleware + route-map style modules**
  - Security, classification, rate-limits, and route dispatch now split under `web/http/*`.
  - Behavior preserved (non-destructive).

- [ ] **Refactor `src/channels/web.ts` into narrower services**
  - In progress: extracted route dispatching, TOTP lockout bookkeeping, session cookie/auth helpers, internal-secret verification helper, WebAuthn challenge helpers, WebAuthn auth endpoint orchestration, passkey enrol page response, TOTP verify endpoint orchestration, manifest response helper, post mutation endpoint orchestration, agent status/context/models helpers, workspace/thought/ui-response endpoint helpers, timeline/hashtag/search/thread/thought endpoint helpers, agents/avatar endpoint helpers, thought/draft buffer/panel state service, inflight-recovery/pending-resume orchestration, auth-runtime mode/context helpers, auth/session/passkey request-surface gateway, endpoint context builders (post/agent/content/ui/identity/avatar), agent status persistence lifecycle service, pending steering queue service, interaction broadcast context helper, follow-up placeholder queue service, and chat run control helpers (thread-root lookup/resume/failed-run cursor skip).
  - Pending: split remaining auth/session/status/passkey orchestration responsibilities further.

- [ ] **Refactor `src/runtime.ts` into composition root + startup/shutdown managers**
  - In progress: provider bootstrap, shutdown orchestration, startup/wiring helpers, message-loop coordinator extraction, runtime core composition/signal binding helpers (`runtime/composition.ts`), runtime bootstrap orchestration/default dependency wiring (`runtime/bootstrap.ts`), and interface narrowing across runtime wiring/coordinator/provider bootstrap.
  - Pending: complete remaining runtime-owned interface narrowing and reduce residual global composition coupling.

- [ ] **Architectural dependency boundaries**
  - In progress: removed web session-binder `as any` cast path, tightened UI bridge/context typing (including pending/custom flow and typed context bridge access), shifted runtime wiring/coordinator to interface-based dependency contracts, extracted runtime core composition/signal registration boundaries (`runtime/composition.ts`), extracted runtime bootstrap orchestration dependency boundaries (`runtime/bootstrap.ts`), removed runtime provider-bootstrap peeking into private `AgentPool` internals, and encapsulated web mutable state/orchestration (thought/draft/panel + recovery/resume + auth-runtime mode/context + auth/session/passkey request-surface + endpoint-context construction + agent-status persistence + pending-steering + interaction-broadcast + follow-up-placeholder + chat-run-control flows) behind dedicated services.
  - Pending: remove remaining internal peeking/casts and formalize service interfaces/ports.

- [ ] **Extension contract hardening**
  - Pending: remove deep/dist imports and `src/*` coupling where avoidable.

- [ ] **Type quality pass**
  - In progress: removed high-risk `any` usage from `src/ipc.ts` payload/update paths, from runtime provider bootstrap + `AgentPool` provider-registration boundary, unified web thought/draft buffer typing via shared `web/agent-buffers.ts` contracts, introduced typed recovery/resume context boundaries in `web/recovery.ts`, introduced typed auth-runtime config/context builders in `web/auth-runtime.ts`, added typed auth/session/passkey gateway boundaries in `web/auth-gateway.ts`, introduced typed endpoint context builder boundaries in `web/endpoint-contexts.ts`, added typed runtime core factory/signal registrar boundaries in `runtime/composition.ts`, added typed runtime bootstrap dependency boundaries in `runtime/bootstrap.ts`, centralized agent-status lifecycle typing in `web/agent-status-store.ts`, typed pending-steering queue semantics in `web/pending-steering.ts`, generalized interaction broadcast channel typing in `web/interaction-service.ts`/`web/interaction-broadcaster.ts`, isolated follow-up placeholder queue typing in `web/followup-placeholders.ts`, and added typed chat run control boundaries in `web/chat-run-control.ts`.
  - Pending: continue reducing `any` density in remaining hotspots (`src/runtime.ts`, `src/channels/web.ts`, and broader `src/agent-pool.ts` paths).

- [ ] **Commenting/documentation standards consistency**
  - In progress: extracted seam modules include module-level purpose headers and JSDoc on exported contracts/helpers (recently reaffirmed for `runtime/composition.ts` and `runtime/bootstrap.ts`).
  - Pending: apply same standards to remaining large hotspots touched in upcoming tranches and enforce in review checklist.

- [ ] **Test redundancy analysis (suite signal-to-noise)**
  - Pending: inventory overlapping tests/assertions and near-duplicate fixture setups across hot suites (`test/channels/web/*`, runtime wiring/bootstrap/coordinator suites, and script guard suites).
  - Pending: consolidate redundant cases while preserving behavior-critical/security regression coverage.

- [ ] **Dead code review and removal**
  - Pending confirmation for `src/db/auto-compaction.ts`, `src/channels/web/ui-context.ts`, and stale dist allowlist items.

- [x] **I/O and concurrency hygiene (loop lifecycle controls)**
  - Stoppable IPC/scheduler loops implemented and shutdown-aware.

## P2 (stabilization/polish)

- [ ] Frontend modularization of large UI components (`web/src/app.ts`, larger components)
- [ ] Security-in-depth extras (session token storage hardening, key-provider abstraction)
- [ ] Operational observability (request IDs, queue/scheduler metrics)

---

## 3) Dead code / stale code inventory (current)

- Potentially removable or reintegrate-with-justification:
  - `src/db/auto-compaction.ts`
  - `src/channels/web/ui-context.ts` (verify runtime vs test-only role)
- Stale dist artifacts:
  - Guarded by `check:stale-dist` + explicit allowlist (non-destructive mode)
  - Planned burn-down after in-progress/legacy streams stabilize

---

## 4) Quality bars (acceptance criteria)

## Security bars
- [x] No raw `startsWith` containment checks for workspace path security.
- [x] Forwarded headers trusted only under explicit proxy mode.
- [x] CSRF validation includes scheme+host+port.
- [x] SSRF callback validation includes DNS/IP private-range protections.

## Architecture bars
- [ ] No backend module > 600 LOC in `src/` (except justified cases).
- [ ] `runtime.ts` reduced to composition/bootstrap responsibilities.
- [ ] No cross-layer internal peeking via `as any`/private field casts.

## Maintainability/reusability bars
- [ ] `any` usage reduced to target threshold.
- [x] Shared web request helpers and routing logic centralized.
- [ ] Optional extensions depend only on stable exported APIs.
- [ ] New/refactored seam modules include module headers + JSDoc on exported contracts/functions.

## Testing/quality bars
- [ ] Line coverage >= 75% overall and >= 85% for security-critical modules.
- [ ] Redundancy audit completed: overlapping/duplicate tests identified, justified, and reduced without coverage regressions.
- [ ] CI checks for dead exports/modules and import-boundary rules.
- [x] Packaging CI-style checks in place (`check:pack-hygiene`, `check:stale-dist`).

## Release/package bars
- [x] Tarball hygiene guardrails implemented.
- [ ] Single final runtime artifact strategy fully enforced with legacy artifacts retired.

## 5) Suggested execution order (next)

1. **Runtime decomposition tranche**
   - Split `runtime.ts` into composition root + lifecycle managers.
2. **Web channel service decomposition tranche**
   - Continue extracting responsibilities from `web.ts` while preserving behavior.
3. **Type-safety tranche**
   - Add schemas/DTOs for IPC/runtime/remote payload boundaries.
4. **Extension API hardening tranche**
   - Remove deep/internal imports and define stable integration surface.
5. **Dead-code and stale-artifact burn-down (safe mode first)**
   - Produce non-destructive reports, then remove with explicit confirmation.
6. **Test redundancy analysis tranche**
   - Inventory and reduce redundant overlapping tests while preserving critical regression coverage.
7. **Coverage/CI bars uplift**
   - Raise coverage and enforce architecture/packaging gates in CI.
