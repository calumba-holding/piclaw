## 1) Overview table (maintainability, reusability, security, architecture, dead code)

| Area | Current state | Risk | Priority | Main improvements |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| Architecture boundaries | Web router is now modularized under `src/channels/web/http/*`; `runtime.ts` and `web.ts` still large | Medium | P1 | Continue decomposition of runtime/bootstrap and `web.ts` orchestration services |
| Maintainability | Significant improvement in web routing/service extraction; large core files remain | Medium | P1 | Continue focused decomposition + reduce module LOC concentration |
| Reusability | Web helpers now centralized; extension API boundaries still mixed (`src/*` and deep imports in some areas) | Medium | P1 | Stabilize extension-facing internal API and remove brittle deep import paths |
| Type safety / best practices | `any` usage still elevated in selected core modules | Medium | P1 | Add typed DTO/schemas for IPC/runtime/events and reduce high-density `any` hotspots |
| Security (local/web/remote) | P0 hardening implemented and covered by tests | Low | P0 (done) | Maintain + regressions + audit for new surfaces |
| Dead code / stale artifacts | Stale-dist detection in place (allowlist-based); destructive cleanup deferred due in-progress feature constraint | Medium | P1 | Non-destructive inventory -> confirm ownership -> gradual allowlist burn-down |
| Quality gates | Lint/tests/package guard checks in use; coverage bar still below target | Medium | P1 | Add CI coverage floor + architecture/static analysis guardrails |

## 2) Detailed checklist of fixes

## P0 (security/release safety)

- [x] **Fix path traversal boundary check for scheduled shell cwd**
  - `src/utils/task-validation.ts` now uses robust containment validation.
  - Regression tests added.

- [x] **Harden client identity for rate limiting/auth logs**
  - Trusted proxy mode added.
  - Centralized request client/origin extraction.

- [x] **Strengthen CSRF origin validation**
  - Full origin tuple validation (scheme+host+port).
  - Security tests updated.

- [x] **Harden remote callback SSRF defenses**
  - DNS resolve + private/loopback/link-local IP blocking (IPv4/IPv6).
  - Remote SSRF tests added.

- [x] **Packaging cleanup / release safety**
  - Runtime packaging guardrails and tarball hygiene checks added.
  - `files` allowlist + stale-dist checks integrated.

- [ ] **Dead/stale artifact cleanup (final destructive pass)**
  - Partial: stale-dist quality gate active with explicit allowlist.
  - Pending: safely retire allowlisted legacy artifacts once in-progress work stabilizes.

## P1 (active wave)

- [x] **Refactor web router into middleware + route-map style modules**
  - Security, classification, rate-limits, and route dispatch now split under `web/http/*`.
  - Behavior preserved (non-destructive).

- [ ] **Refactor `src/channels/web.ts` into narrower services**
  - In progress: extracted route dispatching, TOTP lockout bookkeeping, session cookie/auth helpers, internal-secret verification helper, and WebAuthn challenge helpers.
  - Pending: split auth/session/status/passkey and orchestration responsibilities further.

- [ ] **Refactor `src/runtime.ts` into composition root + startup/shutdown managers**
  - In progress: provider bootstrap, shutdown orchestration, startup/wiring helpers, and message-loop coordinator extracted.
  - Pending: finalize interface narrowing around runtime-owned dependencies and reduce remaining global composition coupling.

- [ ] **Architectural dependency boundaries**
  - Pending: remove internal peeking/casts and formalize service interfaces/ports.

- [ ] **Extension contract hardening**
  - Pending: remove deep/dist imports and `src/*` coupling where avoidable.

- [ ] **Type quality pass**
  - Pending: reduce `any` density in `src/ipc.ts`, `src/runtime.ts`, `src/channels/web.ts`, `src/agent-pool.ts`.

- [ ] **Dead code review and removal**
  - Pending confirmation for `src/db/auto-compaction.ts`, `src/channels/web/ui-context.ts`, and stale dist allowlist items.

- [x] **I/O and concurrency hygiene (loop lifecycle controls)**
  - Stoppable IPC/scheduler loops implemented and shutdown-aware.

## P2 (stabilization/polish)

- [ ] Frontend modularization of large UI components (`web/src/app.ts`, larger components)
- [ ] Security-in-depth extras (session token storage hardening, key-provider abstraction)
- [ ] Operational observability (request IDs, queue/scheduler metrics)

---

## 3) Dead code / stale code inventory (current)

- Potentially removable or reintegrate-with-justification:
  - `src/db/auto-compaction.ts`
  - `src/channels/web/ui-context.ts` (verify runtime vs test-only role)
- Stale dist artifacts:
  - Guarded by `check:stale-dist` + explicit allowlist (non-destructive mode)
  - Planned burn-down after in-progress/legacy streams stabilize

---

## 4) Quality bars (acceptance criteria)

## Security bars
- [x] No raw `startsWith` containment checks for workspace path security.
- [x] Forwarded headers trusted only under explicit proxy mode.
- [x] CSRF validation includes scheme+host+port.
- [x] SSRF callback validation includes DNS/IP private-range protections.

## Architecture bars
- [ ] No backend module > 600 LOC in `src/` (except justified cases).
- [ ] `runtime.ts` reduced to composition/bootstrap responsibilities.
- [ ] No cross-layer internal peeking via `as any`/private field casts.

## Maintainability/reusability bars
- [ ] `any` usage reduced to target threshold.
- [x] Shared web request helpers and routing logic centralized.
- [ ] Optional extensions depend only on stable exported APIs.

## Testing/quality bars
- [ ] Line coverage >= 75% overall and >= 85% for security-critical modules.
- [ ] CI checks for dead exports/modules and import-boundary rules.
- [x] Packaging CI-style checks in place (`check:pack-hygiene`, `check:stale-dist`).

## Release/package bars
- [x] Tarball hygiene guardrails implemented.
- [ ] Single final runtime artifact strategy fully enforced with legacy artifacts retired.

## 5) Suggested execution order (next)

1. **Runtime decomposition tranche**
   - Split `runtime.ts` into composition root + lifecycle managers.
2. **Web channel service decomposition tranche**
   - Continue extracting responsibilities from `web.ts` while preserving behavior.
3. **Type-safety tranche**
   - Add schemas/DTOs for IPC/runtime/remote payload boundaries.
4. **Extension API hardening tranche**
   - Remove deep/internal imports and define stable integration surface.
5. **Dead-code and stale-artifact burn-down (safe mode first)**
   - Produce non-destructive reports, then remove with explicit confirmation.
6. **Coverage/CI bars uplift**
   - Raise coverage and enforce architecture/packaging gates in CI.
